Complete the table below with your results, and then provide your interpretation at the end.

Note that:

- When calculating the parallel speed-up S, use the time output by the code, which corresponds
  to the parallel calculation and does not include reading in the file or performing the serial check.

- Take as the serial execution time the time output by the code when run with a single process
  (hence the speed-up for 1 process must be 1.0, as already filled in the table).


No. Process:                        Mean time (average of 3 runs)           Parallel speed-up, S:
